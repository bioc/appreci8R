* Sample1.bam and Sample2.bam:
Both samples result from patients with myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). Targeted sequencing was
perfromed on Illumina HiSeq (coverage >50x 95%).

* Sample1.bai and Sample2.bai:
The indexes were generated using PicardTools.

* Sample1.rawMutations.vcf and Sample2.rawMutations.vcf:
Variant calling results from GATK HaplotypeCaller 3.3 (using default settings).
However, the original output was reduced to contain only a few exemplary variants
(true positive as well as false positive calls).

Samples 1 and 2 correspond to UPN_Tr1_001 and UPN_Tr1_002.
Information on all mutations, polymorphisms and artifacts detected in these two samples
is available as supplementary data at Bioinformatics online.
The BAM files (containing more than just exemplary regions) are available via the
NCBI SRA (BioProjectID: 388411; https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bioproject/PRJNA388411)
